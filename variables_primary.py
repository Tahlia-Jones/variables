# Print
#   7) Print all the new variables you've created along with what the represent
#
# Example Code
example_sum = 11 + 21
print('EXAMPLE: the sum of 11 and 21 is', example_sum)

# WRITE CODE BELOW
sum = 10 + 25
print('the sum of 10 and 21 is', sum)
sum = 2 * 7 * 8
print('the sum of 2 and 7 and 8', sum)
sum = 112 / 4
print('the sum of 112 and 4', sum)
sum = 'tahlia' + 'jugars'
print('the sum of tahlia and jugars', sum)
print('lmao' * 24)
sum = 4 - 2
print('the sum of 4 and 2', sum)
sum = 2 ** 2
print('the sum of 2 ** 2', sum)
